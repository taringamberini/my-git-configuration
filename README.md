# my-git-configuration
My current [git](https://git-scm.com/) configuration file.


## Install

Git MUST be installed, even if not yet configured as I would.

At command line run:

```bash
~$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taringamberini/my-git-configuration/master/install-gitconfig.sh
~$ sh install-gitconfig.sh
```

After succesful installation remove the installation script.


## Use

I have configured git to use [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) as diff tool, therefore meld MUST be installed.
